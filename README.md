# API Automation with Pytest

This project demonstrates API automation using Pytest and Python for the Reqres API (https://reqres.in/).


## Overview

The project includes a Python script (`Task.py`) with functions for interacting with the Reqres API, covering operations such as user creation, listing users, updating users, and deleting users. Pytest test cases are written in `tasktest.py` to verify the functionality of these API operations.


## Test Cases
Create User:

Verifies the successful creation of a user.
List Users:

Verifies the successful listing of users.
Update User:

Verifies the successful update of a user.
Delete User:

Verifies the successful deletion of a user.
